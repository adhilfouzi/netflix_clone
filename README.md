# Netflix Clone - Flutter Project

## Overview

This Flutter project is a Netflix mobile application clone integrated with a Database Management System (DBMS) API. The goal is to replicate the user interface and functionality of the Netflix app using Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Project Features

- **Content Display:** Replicate the Netflix interface to showcase movies, TV shows, and other content. Implement features like scrolling carousels, categories, and recommendations.

- **Search Functionality:** Provide a search feature allowing users to find specific content easily.

- **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles with personalized preferences and viewing history.

- **Integration with DBMS API:** Utilize a Database Management System API to manage and retrieve data related to user accounts, content metadata, and viewing history.


For more detailed instructions on Flutter development, refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/).
